## Installation

To install and use this application: clone this application from Github. Once it is on your local computer open the integrated terminal and run npm i in the command line to install the dependencies. Create a .env file in the root to store your database, MYSQL username, and password in a secure file. In the terminal, log in to the MYSQL shell to source the schema.sql file which will create the database. Now you will be able to seed the database. Exit the MYSQL shell and run npm run seed in the command line. Once seeded run npm start in the command line. Expect to see the phrase App listening on port 3001! on the command line. Congratulations, your server is now running.

## Usage

Use Insomnia to interact with the inventory, utlizing the drop down to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. This back end application has all routes in place so that all you have to do as a user is make sure that you have the proper endpoints called in the URL and that JSON format is selected from the dropdown.
